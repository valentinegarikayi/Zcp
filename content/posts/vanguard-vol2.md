The Vanguard began as the newsletter of the Zimbabwe Communist Group and four issues were produced between January and April 2016. With the unification of the Zimbabwe Communist Group and the Zimbabwe Communist League on 1st May 2017, it was agreed that The Vanguard — now simply Vanguard — would now be the responsibility of ZimCom Publishers formerly a subsidiary of the Zimbabwe Communist League and now a subsidiary of the Zimbabwe Communist Party. We aim to publish Vanguard quarterly with three issues this year, 2017.

There will be no Editorial in this issue as the place of the Editorial will be taken by the speech and press release given by Comrade Nicholas Ngqabutho Mabhena, General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Communist Party at the Bulawayo Press Club on 3rd May 2017.
