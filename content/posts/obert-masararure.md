```Zimbabwe Communist Party
CALL FOR SOLIDARITY
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
18th June 2022

in the case of Comrade Obert Masararure President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), falsely arrested and accused of murder, as the teachers of Zimbabwe embark on job action due to salaries well below the Poverty Datum Line. 
Yesterday, 17th June 2022 Comrade Obert Masaraure, President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) was refused bail at Harare Magistrate’s Court after being arrested for the murder of a friend. Comrade Obert, 37, was arrested on Tuesday 15th June accused of murdering Roy Issa in 2016. Previously it had been assumed that Issa had jumped to his death from a seventh-floor window of the Jameson Hotel in Harare.

Prosecutors now say that Masaraure “and his accomplices still at large” beat Issa to death in the street below in the early hours of 2nd June 2016 and will call eight state witnesses.
Comrade Obert’s lawyer Doug Coltart has stated:
“The investigation into this case something of a witch-hunt where the police are not investigating in an impartial manner seeking the truth on what really transpired but… rather appear to be on a mission to frame the accused person with no evidence.” 
Coltart revealed that the prosecution’s star witness was a woman named Samantha Lauti, who was allegedly detained “for an entire day” by the police and “forced to state that it was Masaraure who killed Issa.”

The National Prosecuting Authority alleges that Masaraure, Issa and friends were drinking alcohol at the Quill Club located at Ambassador Hotel, leaving at about 10.30pm on 1st June 2022 to go to Jameson Hotel where Masaraure had a room booked on the 7th floor. The group allegedly continued drinking into the early hours of the next day “until a misunderstanding arose amongst them.”

“The accused [Masaraure] and his accomplices ganged up against Roy Issa and assaulted him on the head with unknown weapons along Park Street adjacent to Jameson Hotel. In order to conceal the offence, they misrepresented that Issa jumped off through the window which resulted in his death.”
The prosecution says a pathologist concluded that Issa died as a result of “brain damage, compound skull fracture and head trauma” before recommending that “police to investigate.”
Coltart stated that the charges were fabricated, insisting that Masaraure was nowhere near the Jameson Hotel at the time of the incident.
“When we are finished, you will see that this is a classic case of trumped-up charges. The police have been constantly changing the allegations against Masaraure in order to come up with a narrative that will specifically pin him.

“Initially, there were allegations that Masaraure pushed Issa out of the window at Jameson Hotel. He was detained on a detention order on those allegations. All of a sudden, all the allegations have changed, new allegations were fabricated to say that Masaraure assaulted Issa to death along Park Street in the early hours of 2nd June 2016.
“Masaraure answered to that in a warned and cautioned statement, giving his alibi that he was not at the scene but at home with his wife.
“Seeing the challenge that indeed Masaraure was not present at the scene at that given time, allegations were changed again to say the deceased was assaulted at 10:30pm.
“Furthermore, the prosecution has not been candid with the court because they did disclose that there was an inquest into this case conducted by the police, at the conclusion of which foul play was ruled out.

“We have been denied access to that inquest report which is a public document. Efforts were made to obtain that report from the clerk of court and it appears that it is missing.”
“We pray that the inquest report be immediately put before this court and a copy be provided to the defence. We pray that the controller at Harare Central Police Station be directed to produce before this court a copy of the detention order of 14th June 2022 for it to be inspected by this court and that all the allegations be thoroughly investigated by the independent section of the police and a report be made to this court.” 

It should be noted that the Death Penalty for murder is still in force in Zimbabwe. Comrade Obert is back in court 1st July 2020.

Comrade Obert Masaraure and other ARTUZ members including Secretary-General Comrade Robson Chere have been repeatedly arrested. Comrade Obert has also been twice abducted by ‘persons unknown’ and severely assaulted.

In December 2020, a 53 year-old primary school teacher Sheila Chisirimunhu, who was peacefully demonstrating for her salary in her home town of Masvingo, was arrested and charged and convicted was:

“participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of the peace or bigotry as defined in section 37 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act”
On 18th December 2020, Comrade Sheila was sentenced me to 16 months imprisonment of which 6 months were suspended and 10 months were effective. A family person, Comrade Sheila 
Chisirimunhu spent the whole of Christmas and New Year locked up, being released on bale on 5th January 2021. Much later that year, charges were dropped.
Currently teachers are receiving the approximate equivalent of US$150 per month plus a COVID allowance of US$75 per month. A total of US$225 per month or in South African Rand R3600 per month. Teachers are often not able to pay school fees for their own children and government promised them an allowance for this which it has failed to pay. In 2018 teachers had agreed a salary of US$540 per month with government (after the collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar, a multi-currency system  was introduced with the US dollar as currency of reference) but in 2019 government introduced the RTGS dollar at 1:1 with the US dollar. Very soon, the value of the RTGS dollar, now once again called the ZimDollar deteriorated. All civil servants, including teachers, have been paid in ZimDollars, but at rates agreed in US dollars. Teachers and others are now demanding to be paid in US dollars or at least with the ZimDollar equivalent. At present the exchange rate is 82:1.

In consequence, the Federation of Zimbabwe Educators’ Unions, FOZEU (which includes ARTUZ, the Progressive Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), Educators’ Union of Zimbabwe (EUZ) and Professional Educators’ Union of Zimbabwe (PEUZ)) has agreed to call teachers out on strike from 27th June to 1st July 2022 and other civil servants are currently being mobilised.
The arrest and trial of Obert Masaraure is obviously political as the parasitic bourgeoisie now in power clamps down on any opposition and seeks to keep the working class in bondage.
The Zimbabwe Communist Party gives its full support to our teachers in their job action. 

We further point out that we cannot expect people unable to adequately support themselves and their families to teach our children well under these conditions. Government harassment of teachers makes the problem worse. This problem is of little interest to our ruling elite who send their children to expensive private schools, often to other countries.
We call on trade unions, communist and workers’ parties and all progressive organisations and individuals to send solidarity messages to:
